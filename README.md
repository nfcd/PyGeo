# PyGeo
Python for Geosciences: This is the first part of a PhD course entitled "Python and Machine learning for Geosciences", which was offered by the University of Stavanger (part 1: Python, Nestor Cardozo) and the University of Oslo (part 2: ML, Behzad Alaei and Anita Torabi) on 2022, and was sponsored by [NFIP](https://nfip.no/2022/03/07/python-and-machine-learning-for-geosciences/).

This first part consists of five days, each one consisting of lectures (notebooks folder), and lab exercises (lab folder). Data, figures, and functions are included in their corresponding folders.

- Day 1 covers the fundamentals: Variable types, control flow, functions and classes.

- Day 2 covers reading, plotting, and animating data

- Day 3 covers statistics and uncertainties

- Day 4 covers orientation data, grids, and images

- Day 5 covers well logs and seismic data. Notice that the data for the well logs' notebook are not included. These data are from the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate (NPD). If you are in Norway, please contact me and I would be happy to provide a link to the data.

Follow the course by completing first the notebooks, and then solving the lab exercises. If you are new to Python, follow the days in sequential order, since every day builds up from the days before.

**Note**: You will need a Python distribution to do the course. I recommend Anaconda. The preliminaries.pdf explains how to install Anaconda.

**Acknowledgements**: Comments and corrections by Manuel David Soto Gonzalez, Wiktor Weibull, Lina Jonassen, and the PhDs who took the course greatly improved this content.
