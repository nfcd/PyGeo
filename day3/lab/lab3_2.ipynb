    "The coordinate system of the phone and its relations to a North-East-Down coordinate system are shown in the figure below (from [Allmendinger et al., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191814117301529?via%3Dihub)):\n",

    "The change in orientation of the device is given by the pitch, roll, and yaw angles (figure above). These can be translated to geological orientation, by calculating the unit vector parallel to $X'_3$ (the normal to the phone) for planes, and another vector parallel to $X'_2$ (the long axis of the phone) for lines. The equations are given by Allmendinger et al. (2017) and for convenience, I have summarized them in the functions below, which calculate the strike and dip of a plane or the trend and plunge of a line from the pitch, roll and yaw:"
