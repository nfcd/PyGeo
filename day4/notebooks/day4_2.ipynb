    "Grids are very important in geosciences. Basically, a grid is just a set of regularly spaced points in x and y, with some information (elevation, depth, thickness, etc.) at each point. A digital elevation model (DEM) is a good example. At each point in the DEM grid, the elevation is known. This notebook illustrates the visualization of grids in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Grid data are often available, but sometimes we need to reconstruct the grid from sparse data which is not regularly spaced. This process is known as interpolation, and in this notebook we describe it as well. "
