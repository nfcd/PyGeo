    "# Day 4-Part 1: Orientation data\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will look at the analysis of orientation data, mainly lines and planes, which are typically visualized on stereonets.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lines and planes\n",
    "\n",
    "The geometry of geological structures can be described mainly using two simple elements, lines and planes: \n",
    "\n",
    "- The orientation of a line (e.g., a lineation or a fold axis) is specified by the trend (the angle the horizontal projection of the line makes with the geographic north), and plunge (the angle the line makes with the horizontal on a vertical plane containing the line). The trend is an azimuth angle between 0 and 360$^\\circ$, the plunge is an angle between -90 (line pointing upwards) and 90$^\\circ$ (line pointing downwards). We typically work with lines that point downwards (positive plunge).\n",
    "- The orientation of a plane (e.g., bedding or a fault plane) is specified by the strike (the angle that a horizontal line on the plane makes with the geographic north), and dip (the angle that the plane makes with the horizontal measured on a vertical plane perpendicular to strike). The strike is an azimuth angle between 0 and 360$^\\circ$, and the dip is an angle between 0 and 90$^\\circ$. To avoid any ambiguity with respect to the strike direction, the preferred choice is to give the strike such that the dip direction is 90$^\\circ$ to the right of it. This is called the right-hand rule or RHR (if your right hand thumb is along the strike direction, the other fingers will point towards the dip direction).\n",

    "In addition, if a line happens to be on a plane (e.g., a current lineation on a sedimentary bed), we can specify the orientation of the line by the angle the line makes with the strike line of the plane, measured on the plane. This is called the rake.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we can also specify the orientation of a plane by the downward normal to the plane, which is known as the pole to the plane. The figure below illustrates these concepts:\n",
