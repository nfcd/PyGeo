    "## Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple words, a function is a collective group of statements. The idea behind the use of functions is to reuse the code. Whenever you want to execute a group of statements more than once, then you need to create a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions are like devices that can take input parameters and provide output. The output of the function can be either a data, or operation on the parameter passed to the function. Basically, there are two main reasons we use functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Maximum code reuse and minimum redundant programming\n",
    "- Well structured programming, i.e. divide a large, complex task into smaller, simpler parts\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax of a function is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def function_name(arg_1, arg_2...arg_n):\n",
    "    statements\n",
    "    return val\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`def` is the header of the function, it generates the function object and assigns a name to it. In the parentheses, the input parameters are included. When the function does not have any input parameter, then the parentheses is left empty. After the colon `:`, the function statements are included. The `return` statement returns a value. If `val` is not specified, the function return`None`. Both the `val` and the `return` statements are optional.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the polygon's perimeter example of the previous notebook, suppose we'd like to determine how the perimeter of the polygon changes with the average length of the added segments, as represented by the variable `step` in the range 1 (all points) to 50 (every 50th points). Obviously, we don't want to run a cell with the same code but different `step` 50 times! The solution is to create a function that calculates the perimeter of the polygon for a given `step`:"

    "### Classes\n",

    "Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming strategy based on the concept of objects, which can contain data and code. The main buliding blocks of OOP are classes and objects. Classes represent broad categories, like the items in a store or physical objects that share similar attributes. An object contains real data and is built (or instantiated) from the class. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, for an organization we could define a class called employee, with attributes such as the name and salary of the employee, and methods such as raise_salary. We can then create instance objects (actual employees) from this class, and access their attributes or increase their salaries when needed. Employees are obviously not identical, so although they inherit attributes and methods from the employee class, they can have their own attributes and methods. You get the idea, OOP is very powerful. It is behind many of the libraries and functions we use in this course.\n",
